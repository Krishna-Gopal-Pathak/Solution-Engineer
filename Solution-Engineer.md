<b>1. What is microprocessor?</b>
<p></p>
<p>- A microprocessor is a device that is operated by a program.</p>
<p>- It read the data instruction from memory and decode before executing the instruction.</p>

<b>2. How would you decide the price of solution</b>
<p></p>
<p>- The Purpose of pricing is to maximize the solution's long term profit based on the value it gives to clients.</p>
<p>- Value pricing is one way to achieve this goal. The best price is determined by how much value your offering delivers to clients in comparision to their other options</p>

**First, i'd like to know what your point of differentiation is. What other options do your prospects have for resolving their business issues?**
<p></p>
<p>In dollars and cents, how much value do your unique solutions create for your customers? On this basis, i will price my solution.</p>

<b>3. What is over clocking? what are the benefits of over clocking?</b>
<p></p>
<p>- It is a method of forcing a computer component to run at a higher clock rate.</p>
<p>- Improve GPU Performance</p>
<p>- Saves money</p>

<b>Define Cache Memory? What is the Advantage of having additional cache memory in a processor?</b>
<p>- The memory space between processor and ram is known as cache memory</p>
<p>- The system's speed will grow as the cache memory is increased.</p>


<b>Define criteria or things to consider producing a good solution</b>
<p>I generally look for these five things:</p>
<p>Depth</p>
<p>Intellience</p>
<p>Completeness</p>
<p>Empowering Ability</p>
<p>Elegance</p>
<p>In conclusion, the optimal solution is one that is fully featured(depth), demonstrates that you understand customer demands(intelligence) includs assistance(completeness), empowers clients(empowering), and is simple to use(elegance)</p>

<b>Can you define some techniques to gather requirements or information from the clients?</b>
<p>I did like to begin with Brainstorming in order to get as many ideas as possible from a group of people so that i can find potential solutions to problems and establish details of opportunities.</p>
<p>Then i will go on to document analysis where i will look over the documentation of an existing system to see if there is anything i can learn from it to assist me to create an AS-IS process document</p>
<p>A Focus group is necessary to obtain input from a group of people who are representative of a product's customers or users. Following that i will go on to the interface analysis to ensure that we produce useable software</p>
<p>Other steps will include interviews of stakeholders and users, observation, prototyping, reverse engineering and survey and questionnaire</p>

<b>What are the steps to come out with a good product or solution?</b>
<p>The steps that i usually take, involve:</p>
<p>Define your target audience</p>
<p>knowing how to reach audience</p>
<p>Understand the buying journey</p>
<p>Validating the Product</p>
<p>Knowing your competition and be different</p>
<p>Create a free trial or demo</p>
<p>get everyone on the same page</p>
<p>offer early use incentives</p>
<p>keep testing it</p>

<b>What is chipset? How is it Different from Processor and motherboard?</b>
<p>A chipset is one of the computer's processing units</p>
<p>It's a collection of integrated circuits that regulate the flow of data between other components and the processor.</p>
