<b>1. What is microprocessor?</b>
<p></p>
<p>- A microprocessor is a device that is operated by a program.</p>
<p>- It read the data instruction from memory and decode before executing the instruction.</p>

<b>2. How would you decide the price of solution</b>
<p></p>
<p>- The Purpose of pricing is to maximize the solution's long term profit based on the value it gives to clients.</p>
<p>- Value pricing is one way to achieve this goal. The best price is determined by how much value your offering delivers to clients in comparision to their other options</p>

<p>Then i will go on to document analysis where i will look over the documentation of an existing system to see if there is anything i can learn from it to assist me to create an AS-IS process document</p>
<p>A Focus group is necessary to obtain input from a group of people who are representative of a product's customers or users. Following that i will go on to the interface analysis to ensure that we produce useable software</p>
<p>Other steps will include interviews of stakeholders and users, observation, prototyping, reverse engineering and survey and questionnaire</p>

<p>All other components including as the CPU, memory and sockets for external connectors and drives are connected to the motherboard</p>
<p>A motherboard's chipset is a built-in feature</p>
<p>A processor, on the other hand, is a major integrated circuit block that performs functions in response to instructions from a computer program. It is based on system's logic, arithmetic and input/output.</p>

<b>Share with us Your Greatest achievement</b>
<p>When i was working for another organization, we needed to fix a software problem and did it by working as a team after after learning from our earlier mistake </p>

<p>I can apply my previous accomplishments and skills to this position</p>


<b>Describe a time when you failed in this role and the lesson you learnt</b>
<p>In my prior position, we were responsible for developing a solution program, which i described earlier.</p>
<p>This was supposed to be group project but i started working on it on my own. because this took a long time, i was unable to deliver it on time.</p>
<p>This prompted a slew of questions, and i found myself totally speechless.</p>
<p>From then, I learned to operate as part of a team and once i did the work became easier to accomplish and on time</p>
